To demonstrate the basics, we implement a simple client for the character generator
protocol defined in RFC 864. This protocol is designed for testing clients. The server
listens for connections on a port. When a client connects, the server sends a continuous
sequence of characters until the client disconnects. Any input from the client is ignored.
The RFC does not specify which character sequence to send, but recommends that the server
use a recognizable pattern. One common pattern is rotating, 72-character carriage
return/linefeed delimited lines of the 95 ASCII printing characters, like this:

	!"#$%&'( )*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefgh
	"#$%&'( )*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghi
	#$%&'( )*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghij
	$%&'( )*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijk
	%&'( )*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijkl
	&'( )*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklm
